Observations made since the turn of the 21st century indicate that the Arctic physical environment and associated ecosystems are undergoing remarkable changes. To understand these ongoing and predict future changes we need to be able to quantify how much of Arctic climate variability and change is linked to the ocean circulation, how the distribution of sea ice responds to the amplified Arctic warming, and how primary productivity, species distributions and associated ecosystem structures will change with the evolving Arctic state. 
Our understanding of the driving mechanisms for these processes depends on our knowledge of the Arctic system and our ability to simulate its time-evolving state in a way that is consistent with observations. 

The NSF-supported project Arctic Sub-polar gyre sTate Estimate (ASTE) project employs an advanced data assimilation approach for synthesizing oceanographic observations to develop a tool that establishes a baseline understanding of the coupled Arctic ocean-sea ice system. Through this computational tool, we are developing a better quantification of the Arctic system's changes over the 21st century, and an improved understanding of the dynamical causes for these changes. 

This project brings together hydrographic observations obtained from ship, aircraft and autonomous instruments, sea ice data from in situ buoys, satellites and manned vessels, and boundary-layer meteorology within a state estimation framework. The joint interpretation of these heterogeneous data streams enables us to develop a more coherent physical and dynamical description of the evolving Arctic Ocean during the 21st century. Taking advantage of a growing observational database, the project's two main objectives are: the creation of a dynamically-consistent and comprehensive synthesis of all available Arctic hydrographic and sea ice observations using the adjoint-based Arctic Sub-polar gyre sTate Estimate for the period 2002-present; and scientific investigations, using the synthesis products, of physical mechanisms driving the evolving Arctic system.
