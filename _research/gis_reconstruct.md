The Greenland ice sheet has emerged as a significant contributor to present-day,and possibly future global sea level rise. Predictions of mass loss are hampered by the lack of comprehensive observational constraints for model calibration, rigorous computational approaches to perform such calibration, transient simulations that evolve into a realistic present state of an ice sheet that may serve as initial condition for predictions, and accurate histories of past surface climates that may serve as surface forcing boundary conditions in ice sheet model simulations. A rigorous approach for treating the issues in combination is through Bayesian inverse methods based on a time-evolving dynamical model and sparse observations. The advent of observational data consisting of stratigraphic horizons of constant age (also known as radar layer or isochrone data) that have been imaged by numerous ice-penetrating radar surveys serve as a powerful paleo proxy data constraint on the past flow and boundary conditions. 

The inverse problem poses a fundamental challenge: can we infer initial and surface boundary conditions, such that simulations based on these inputs match the available observations or proxy data? Solving this inverse problem will enable us to make several key scientific advances. Firstly, we will develop a time-evolving state of the Greenland ice sheet that is consistent with the time history encapsulated in the isochrone data. Secondly, we will infer a set of optimal model parameters (i.e., model calibration) and time-varying optimal surface forcings that are consistent with the underlying ice sheet evolution (i.e., reconstruction of a consistent climate forcing history). And, thirdly, we will develop a realistic transient simulation of the ice sheet over the Holocene period, leading into a present state that may serve as well-balanced initial condition for prediction, and for which initialization shocks or artificial model drift are expected to be minimal, by construction. A key computational ingredient that enables our proposed work is the development of a time-dependent adjoint model of an ice sheet model that is able to evolve internal ice age structures.
