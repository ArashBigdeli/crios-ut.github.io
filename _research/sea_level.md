The science of sea level is surprisingly complex as it connects a wide range of phenomena of the coupled Earth system. Processes contributing to sea level change include ocean dynamics and thermodynamics driven by atmospheric, hydrologic, and cryospheric forcings. They also include gravitational self-attraction, solid Earth deformation, and Earth rotation response to ice mass and terrestrial water storage changes, and vertical land motion resulting from local processes such as tectonics and groundwater extraction.

Understanding and predicting global and regional sea level rise and coastal flooding has enormous societal implications, with an estimated 230 million people today living near the coast at less than 1 m above current high tide lines. Among others, CRIOS members are part of the [NASA Sea Level Change Science Team (N-SLCT)](https://sealevel.nasa.gov/), which seeks to address one of the Science and Applications Priority Areas of the U.S. National Academies’ Decadal Strategy for Earth Observation from Space (2018). Regional Sea-Level Change and Coastal Impacts has also been identified as a Grand Challenge of the [World Climate Research Program (WCRP)](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/grand-challenges/grand-challenges-overview).
